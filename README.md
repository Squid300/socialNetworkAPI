  ## Description  
  This homework was creating an API for a social network application. To do this, MongoDB is being used for the database and express js is being used to create the server to interact with the databse.

  The exact criteria were as follows:
  ```md
  GIVEN a social network API
  WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
  WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
  THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
  WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
  WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
  ```
